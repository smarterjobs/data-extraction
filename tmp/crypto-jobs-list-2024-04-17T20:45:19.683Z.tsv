<ul>
<li>Align acquisition strategies with the organization's overall security objectives.</li>
<li>Provide regular updates on acquisition progress and identify opportunities for improvement.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Skills and Traits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adjustable: can work across timezones.</li>

Founded by Mathieu Baudet, a former Meta/Novi engineer and researcher with a PhD in cryptographic protocols, Linera redefines blockchain scalability by pioneering <strong>microchains</strong> – lightweight chains that operate in parallel within a common set of validators. </p><p>Linera is backed by some of the world's leading investors. We are early in our journey and looking for Rust engineers to join our team.</p><h3><strong>Learn more</strong></h3><p>Linera redefines blockchain scalability by pioneering <strong>microchains</strong> – lightweight chains that operate parallel within a common set of validators.

2024-04-17T13:00:08.471Z	Senior Software Engineer	Shakepay	<p>Join our small, fiery team on a mission to usher in the Bitcoin Golden Age.</p><p><strong>About Shakepay</strong></p>
<p>Shakepay is reimagining financial services to give every Canadian their fair shake, by making it bitcoin-friendly, secure, and rewarding. When Shakepay launched in 2015, it quickly became one of Canada’s fastest-growing financial institutions. Backed by top venture funds having raised $44M+ and trusted by over one million Canadians and counting. People who choose careers at Shakepay are helping shape a future of financial freedom, opportunity, and prosperity for all Canadians.</p>
<h3>Senior Software Engineer</h3>
<p>Imagine shaking your phone to instantly earn bitcoin. Our customers might think it’s magic, but if you’re reading this you probably know that it’s not (or is it?). It’s not. It’s our stellar dev team that makes it happen. That shaking idea started as a secret easter-egg for our fledgling customer base, and once word got out about it, we suddenly had to deal with service outages from too many people shaking at the same time.</p>
<p>Of course we’ve since solved that problem, and now with over 1,000,000 shakers (aka “customers''), it’s a core part of our identity—not the shaking, but the idea that we came up with something new and exciting in the slow and boring world of financial services. We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to help us reimagine how Canadians build wealth and think about what they can do with their money. Unique ideas and the knowledge and determination to make them a reality: that’s the real magic.</p>

Shakepay is reimagining financial services to give every Canadian their fair shake, by making it bitcoin-friendly, secure, and rewarding. When Shakepay launched in 2015, it quickly became one of Canada’s fastest-growing financial institutions. Backed by top venture funds having raised $44M+ and trusted by over one million Canadians and counting. People who choose careers at Shakepay are helping shape a future of financial freedom, opportunity, and prosperity for all Canadians.
<h3>Full Stack Developer</h3>
<p>Imagine shaking your phone to instantly earn bitcoin. Our customers might think it’s magic, but if you’re reading this you probably know that it’s not (or is it?). It’s not. It’s our stellar dev team that makes it happen. That shaking idea started as a secret easter-egg for our fledgling customer base, and once word got out about it, we suddenly had to deal with service outages from too many people shaking at the same time.</p>
<p>Of course we’ve since solved that problem, and now with over 1,000,000 shakers (aka “customers''), it’s a core part of our identity—not the shaking, but the idea that we came up with something new and exciting in the slow and boring world of financial services. We’re looking for an intermediate full stack developer to help us reimagine how Canadians build wealth and think about what they can do with their money. Unique ideas and the knowledge and determination to make them a reality: that’s the real magic.</p>
<p>Totally real Shakepay reviews from the future, after you join:</p>
<p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Does Shakepay run on literal magic?</p>
<p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I thought magic wasn’t real. Using Shakepay changed my mind.</p>
<p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Wow, it must’ve taken all 3 genie wishes to make this app!</p>
<p>Oh yeah, we’re a bitcoin platform. In fact, Shakepay is the easiest way for Canadians to buy and earn bitcoin. We’ve got a one of a kind community of shakers (aka “customers”) that keeps on growing, regardless of how the crypto market is doing. They love Shakepay almost as much as they love bitcoin, which is really saying something. To the Bitcoin Golden Age!</p>

<li><strong>Sourcing new partnerships opportunities:</strong> Using our company goals and strategic priorities, you’ll identify, propose, and explore new and exciting partnership opportunities to take Phantom to the next level. This role requires creativity, applied strategy, and a deep understanding of value creation (for Phantom and partners).</li>
<li><strong>Ensuring the success of existing partners:</strong> We deeply value our existing ecosystem and you’ll help maintain strong, consistent, and transparent relationships with our top partners. Working closely with leaders in Web3, you’ll synthesize feedback, negotiate deal structures, and manage team dynamics on a regular basis.</li>

<li>Comfort working with top tier partners and senior leaders, particularly in pitching new proposals.</li>
<li>Exceptionally strong communication skills, particularly in written mediums.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Work with Us</h3>
<h3>Opportunity</h3>
<p>We are a team of experienced builders with a ton of traction in a big and growing market – our users are so passionate they were hacking their way into our private beta. We've acquired millions of users in our 2+ years and are adding more every week. We are by far the leading wallet on Solana, and have recently expanded onto other chains including Ethereum.</p>
<p>On top of that, there has never been a better time to work in crypto and on wallets in particular.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wallets play a pivotal role:</strong> Wallets are responsible for on-boarding new users into crypto, and can make or break the user experience.</li>
<li><strong>We are moving to a multi-chain world:</strong> New blockchains and scaling solutions are coming online and gaining traction, but are lacking decent wallets and bridges.</li>
<li><strong>DeFi & NFTs are exploding :</strong> Interest in DeFi and NFTs has exploded, yet they are still an after-thought in existing wallets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Competitive salary and equity</li>
<li>Comprehensive insurance (medical/dental/vision) — 100% covered</li>
<li>Stipend for your ideal remote / WFH set-up: laptop, headphones, and any other work gear you may need</li>
<li>Flexible hours and a long-standing, supportive remote environment</li>
<li>Unlimited vacation: Take time when you need it (and we really mean it!)</li>
<li>401(k) retirement plan</li>
<li>Wellness benefit</li>
<li>Daily lunch benefit</li>
</ul>
<p>The target base salary for this role will range between $140,000 to $170,000 with the addition of equity and benefits. This is determined by a few factors including your skillset, prior relevant experience, quality of interviews and market factors (such as location) at the point in time of offer.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mentor engineers, helping them to grow professionally, and create an environment where they feel empowered to contribute their best</li>

<li>Foster an environment where the team can achieve and maintain technical and product expertise, keeping up-to-date with the latest features and usages</li>
<li>Understand the interactions between the proof system, protocol and SDK, and clearly communicate how these components collectively enable zkApps</li>
<li>Collaborate with Product, Marketing, Business Development and other stakeholders to develop and execute well-informed engineering roadmaps</li>
<li>Support Business Development with partner projects through zkApps solutions architects</li>
<li>Contribute to the success and excellence we pride ourselves on at O(1) Labs</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Zero-knowledge proof systems</li>
<li>Cryptography and/or blockchains</li>
<li>Public-facing projects</li>
<li>Novel research and implementation</li>
<li>Programming language theory and design</li>
<li>Javascript or Typescript</li>
<li>API abstractions and high-quality Developer User Experience</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>About us:</strong></h3>
<p>O(1) Labs is the team that incubated, launched and contributes to Mina Protocol, a Layer 1 blockchain that  compresses the blockchain from hundreds of gigabytes down to the size of a few tweets and  can scale to millions of users while remaining decentralized enough for cell phones to be fully verifying nodes.  Using the power of Mina and zk technology we are at the forefront of building a privacy centered Web 3.0. </p>
<p>With this work we are driving the potential to reimagine social structures. We believe in and are dedicated to incorporating diverse perspectives from conception through realization.</p>
<p>Our team is spread out around the world and offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits.</p>

Verifiable computing with zk-SNARKs is taking off as a solution to the scalability and privacy limitations that today's blockchains suffer from. A new wave of blockchain protocols that use zk-SNARKs to prove smart contract executions, such as Polygon zkEVM, Starknet, and zkSync, are already in production. We believe there is a big market opportunity to generate proofs for these networks at scale in a cost-effective way [1]. There are lots of interesting performance engineering challenges we need to solve to keep up with the maximum device throughput. </p><p>We take the approach of co-designing hardware and software systems to accelerate SNARK generation end-to-end. Our first-generation tech stack uses FPGA accelerators running custom digital logic tailor-made for our use case [2]. We also conduct cryptography research to identify computationally efficient algorithms for verifiable computing. These research efforts produced a novel cryptographic construction based on towers of binary fields called Binius [3], which we are currently developing into a production-grade system. Our team has cross-domain expertise and includes hardware designers, low-level systems software engineers, cryptography engineers, and data center specialists, several of whom worked in HFT previously.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/04/zk-hardware" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/04/zk-hardware</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://www.ulvetanna.io/news/fpga-architecture-for-goldilocks-ntt" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://www.ulvetanna.io/news/fpga-architecture-for-goldilocks-ntt</a></p><p>[3] <a href="https://www.ulvetanna.io/news/binius-hardware-optimized-snark" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://www.ulvetanna.io/news/binius-hardware-optimized-snark</a></p><p>[4] <a href="https://www.ulvetanna.io/news/introducing-ulvetanna" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://www.ulvetanna.io/news/introducing-ulvetanna</a></p><p><strong>Locations supported: </strong></p><p>We’re looking for candidates who are located between the USA East Coast and Central Europe time zones.

We’re a high-performance cryptography startup (with an exciting hardware twist) looking to expand our cryptography team. <em>A more technical description of what we do below! </em>If you're a Cryptographer passionate about the Zero Knowledge space, read on!</p><p><strong>What will you do: </strong></p><ul><li><p>Help in developing binary proof systems by designing secure protocols, implementing strong cryptographic algorithms, conducting a thorough analysis, integrating security measures, and fostering innovation.</p></li><li><p>Stay updated on the latest advancements in cryptography, and review research in the space to see how it can be adapted to our proof system, Binius.</p></li><li><p>Collaborate with cross-functional teams and implement cryptographic solutions in our software/hardware environment.  </p></li><li><p>Work with the team to publish papers, ensuring our research gets viewed by the wider field.</p></li></ul><p><strong>About you: </strong></p><p>You are a researcher fascinated by cryptography and excited to “solve the unsolvable.” You are a direct, respectful, and clear communicator who gets laser-focused on a topic and can discuss it for hours.

Verifiable computing with zk-SNARKs is taking off as a solution to the scalability and privacy limitations that today's blockchains suffer from. A new wave of blockchain protocols that use zk-SNARKs to prove smart contract executions, such as Polygon zkEVM, Starknet, and zkSync, are already in production. We believe there is a big market opportunity to generate proofs for these networks at scale in a cost-effective way [1]. There are lots of interesting performance engineering challenges we need to solve to keep up with the maximum device throughput. </p><p>We take the approach of co-designing hardware and software systems to accelerate SNARK generation end-to-end. Our first-generation tech stack uses FPGA accelerators running custom digital logic tailor-made for our use case [2]. We also conduct cryptography research to identify computationally efficient algorithms for verifiable computing. These research efforts produced a novel cryptographic construction based on towers of binary fields called Binius [3], which we are currently developing into a production-grade system. Our team has cross-domain expertise and includes hardware designers, low-level systems software engineers, cryptography engineers, and data center specialists, several of whom worked in HFT previously.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/04/zk-hardware" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/04/zk-hardware</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://www.ulvetanna.io/news/fpga-architecture-for-goldilocks-ntt" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://www.ulvetanna.io/news/fpga-architecture-for-goldilocks-ntt</a></p><p>[3] <a href="https://www.ulvetanna.io/news/binius-hardware-optimized-snark" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://www.ulvetanna.io/news/binius-hardware-optimized-snark</a></p><p>[4] <a href="https://www.ulvetanna.io/news/introducing-ulvetanna" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://www.ulvetanna.io/news/introducing-ulvetanna</a></p><p><strong>Locations supported: </strong></p><p>We’re looking for candidates who are <strong>located between the USA East Coast and Central Europe time zones</strong>.

We work closely with our community to ensure that our products have a positive impact, are secure, and can be used in production at scale.</p><h3>Our Impact</h3><p>Since the launch of Flashbots, we have had an immense impact on the world of cryptocurrency. The Flashbots Auction was launched in alpha in January 2021 and was quickly adopted by almost all Ethereum miners. Prior to Ethereum's Merge in 2022, Flashbots launched MEV-Boost, a temporary solution for out-of-protocol proposer-builder separation. MEV-Boost has since been adopted by over 90% of Ethereum validators and has significantly influenced the Ethereum PoS ecosystem. Now, Flashbots continues its journey with the introduction of MEV-Share as we continue our journey toward SUAVE.</p><h3>Our Research</h3><p>Flashbots Research is an independent arm of the organization that aims to become the hub of MEV research. In addition to conducting in-house analysis, Flashbots Research collaborates with external researchers at other institutions via an external grants program. Flashbots Research continues to publish seminal research on MEV, covering a wide range of topics including cross-chain MEV, EIP1559 and MEV, how ETH2 affects MEV, SGX and privacy, and more.
